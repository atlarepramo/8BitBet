To do: Successfully create Player initilzation.
        This will allow user to input the number of players who will be playing the game. 
         For each player define: name
                                 bet on the final score of a round
                                 bet on what will be the cause of death
                                 bet on number of clouds in foreground
        
        After Player initilzation is completed need to allow for inputs for: Final score of round, cause of death, # of clouds.
        These inputs will serve as the proxy until the game development is complete and we figure out how to send these inputs 
        to our source code from the game.

        Lastly, we need to create the code that compares the definitions in the Player Class for final score, CoD, and Cloud#.
        The code will need to declare winners of main bets and side bets. 
        Main bet is whoever had the highest score in the game between all players, side bets are the three aforementioned         
          variables.
        Code will also need to determine the payout to each players. Each bet will be treated as one unit (ex. one dollar). 
        
        Once we have a totally polished table that can reliably do all these things then need to focus on how to get the game 
           to output the values the table needs to function and maybe even try our hand at some game development.
