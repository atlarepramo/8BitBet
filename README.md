Done: create Player initialization

To do: create comparison functions to determine winner based on Player Class inputs. (ex. High scores, # of Clouds, CoD, etc.)
        
        
      
        We need to create the code that compares the definitions in the Player Class for final score, CoD, and Cloud#.
        The code will need to declare winners of main bets and side bets. 
        Main bet is whoever had the highest score in the game between all players, side bets are the three aforementioned         
          variables.
        Code will also need to determine the payout to each players. Each bet will be treated as one unit (ex. one dollar). 
        
        Once we have a totally polished table that can reliably do all these things then need to focus on how to get the game 
           to output the values the table needs to function and maybe even try our hand at some game development.
